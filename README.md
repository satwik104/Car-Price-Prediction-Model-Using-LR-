The past decade has witnessed a substantial increase in car production rates, reaching nearly 92 million cars manufactured in 2019. This surge has notably fueled the growth of the used car market, emerging as a thriving industry. The advent of online platforms has heightened the necessity for customers, clients, dealers, and sellers to remain abreast of current market trends to ascertain the genuine value of pre-owned vehicles. Amidst the myriad applications of machine learning, its impactful utilization in predictive problem-solving stands out. This project centers on leveraging Machine Learning Algorithms, particularly Linear Regression, to predict the price of used cars and construct a statistical model using a provided dataset with specific attributes.

In this era marked by rapid advancements, our study pioneers an innovative approach to predicting automobile prices. Our solution, employing Machine Learning Techniques, aims to offer widespread assistance, significantly saving time and costs associated with estimating vehicle values. Predicting car prices remains a crucial field, demanding substantial expertise and thorough effort. We meticulously scrutinized a diverse range of attributes to enable precise and reliable predictions. Utilizing Linear Regression, a prominent machine learning technique, we developed a model for forecasting used car prices. This approach involves multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable, allowing us to compare actual and predicted values to evaluate prediction accuracy. Our research introduces a system wherein the dependent variable, the price, is forecasted based on factors like mileage, production year, and various other attributes.
